Allow Multi Currency Pricelist in Point of Sale
When a user applies price-list for the point of sale, then it may have different currency on different pricelist, but By default Odoo only support POS pricelist for single currency on point of sale session. That's why when people have different currency on different price-list they cannot apply it in pos session/configuration. We provide a solution with this app which helps user to use multiple price-list with different in point of sale and when the relevant price list is applied on POS screen currency conversation are automatically done based on accounting currency rate and. When User select the different currency's pricelist then order amount and all products price is effected based on exchange rate of the currency
